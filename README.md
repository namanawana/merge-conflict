# Narrative-to-Audio Compiler

## Problem
Current text-to-speech systems lack narrative understanding, emotional continuity, and speaker consistency.

## Solution
This project implements a compiler-style pipeline that converts plain text stories into a structured narrative execution plan before rendering expressive multi-speaker audio.
